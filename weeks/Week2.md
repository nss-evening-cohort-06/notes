## How can I make my program do something interesting?

#### Logical Operators
- C# operators - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/
#### Control Flow in C#
- Branching
	- if...else
	- switch
- Looping
	- for, foreach, while, do->while
	- continue v. break
	- return v. throw
- Try and Catch Exceptions - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/index
- `TryParse()` with `out` variable declaration v. `as` operator
	- no need to tryparse in a try-catch. You actually want an exception to be thrown so that you can catch it.
- Async - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/control-flow-in-async-programs

#### Collections

In Javascript you have arrays and objects. In C# you have [Collections](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/06_COLLECTIONS.md). You'll be learning about only a couple of the most common ones.

> .NET has [lots](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/formatting/concepts/csharp-language/collections.md) and [lots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic?view=netframework-4.7.1) of types of [collections](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/02_FIRST_EXECUTABLE.md#c-collections). List and Dictionary are the most common ones.

- Lists
	- [Random Square](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/exercises/10_RANDOMSQUARED.md)
	- [Planets and Spaceships](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/exercises/01_LISTS.md)
- Dictionaries
	- [Family Dictionary](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/exercises/08_FAMILY_DICTIONARY.md)
	- [Stock Purchase Dictionary](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/exercises/03_DICTIONARIES.md)
