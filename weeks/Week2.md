## How can I make my program do something interesting?

### Logical Operators
- [C# operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/)

	- `==` is the new `===`.
	- `is` v. `as` for type conversion (without inheritance)

### Control Flow in C#
- Branching
	- `if` :twisted_rightwards_arrows: `else`
	- `switch`
- Looping
	- `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do` :arrow_right_hook: `while`
	- [`continue`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/continue) v. [`break`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/break)
	- `return` v. `throw`
- [`try` and `catch` Exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/index)
	- `TryParse()` with `out` variable declaration v. `as` operator
- [`async` and `await`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/control-flow-in-async-programs)

##### Exercises

- Collecting your favorite things
    - Create 1 more favorite thing class.
    - Create a List to contain each of your favorite things
    - Add 3 instances of each type of thing to the correct list
    - Loop over each list and print out text to the console for each item.

### Collections

In Javascript you have arrays and objects. In C# you have [Collections](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/06_COLLECTIONS.md). You'll be learning about only a couple of the most common ones.

> .NET has [lots](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/formatting/concepts/csharp-language/collections.md) and [lots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic?view=netframework-4.7.1) of types of [collections](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/02_FIRST_EXECUTABLE.md#c-collections). List and Dictionary are the most common ones.
